raspivid-crosshair
==================

My code compilation for overlaying a simple crosshair on a raspivid preview window output.

This simple code should allow a user to run one command and display a simple crosshair overlaying a 
raspivid preview window.

To run the raspivid with the crosshair... 

Simply go into this folder via a terminal window
and run

./raspivid-crosshair.bin
